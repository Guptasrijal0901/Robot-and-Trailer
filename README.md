# Robot and Trailer Simulation 

## Overview
This project is a fun and interactive simulation of a robot towing a trailer. The robot moves step by step, using proximity sensors to estimate distances while dealing with a bit of random noise—just like in the real world! 

## What's Inside?
- A robot that moves and senses its environment with a bit of noise.
- A trailer that faithfully follows behind.
- A smart estimation system that tries to predict travel distance.
- Error analysis to see how well the robot is estimating its movement.
- Beautiful visualizations to track the robot and trailer's journey.

## Getting Started 
To run this simulation, make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## How to Run 
Simply execute the script to see the robot in action:

```bash
python robot_simulation.py
```

## What You'll See 
- **Real-time position updates**: Watch how the robot and trailer move step by step.
- **Trajectory visualization**: A plotted path showing where the robot and trailer have been.
- **Distance estimation vs. reality**: See how close (or far off) the robot's estimates are.

## Performance Metrics 
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Tells us how much the robot's estimated distance differs from reality.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Gives an idea of how much the errors fluctuate.
