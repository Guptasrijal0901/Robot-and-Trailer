# Robot-and-Trailer
Robot and Trailer Simulation 🚀

Overview

This project is a fun and interactive simulation of a robot towing a trailer. The robot moves step by step, using proximity sensors to estimate distances while dealing with a bit of random noise—just like in the real world!

What's Inside?

A robot that moves and senses its environment with a bit of noise.

A trailer that faithfully follows behind.

A smart estimation system that tries to predict travel distance.

Error analysis to see how well the robot is estimating its movement.

Beautiful visualizations to track the robot and trailer's journey.

Getting Started 🚀

To run this simulation, make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed:

pip install numpy matplotlib

How to Run 🏃

Simply execute the script to see the robot in action:

python robot_simulation.py

What You'll See 🎯

Real-time position updates: Watch how the robot and trailer move step by step.

Trajectory visualization: A plotted path showing where the robot and trailer have been.

Distance estimation vs. reality: See how close (or far off) the robot's estimates are.

Performance Metrics 📊

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Tells us how much the robot's estimated distance differs from reality.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Gives an idea of how much the errors fluctuate.
